## makeCacheMatrix function creates container to store matrix and its inverse
## cacheSolve function uses makeCacheMatrix to calculate and cache inverse of 
## a matrix

##
# makeCacheMatrix function acts as a container that stores 2 matrices: matrix1 
# and matrix2 - inverse of matrix1
# matrix1 is passed as argument or stored in the container using set method. 
# get - returns matrix1
# set - sets matrix member to matrix1
# getinverse - returns matrix2
# setinverse - sets matrix2 to matrix argument
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
# x - matrix argument or matrix member if set
# ix - matrix member to store inverse
	ix <- NULL
    set <- function(m) {
	# sets x and ix values in parent environment
         x <<- m
		 ix <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(im) ix <<- im
    getinverse <- function() ix
    list(set = set, get = get,
        setinverse = setinverse,
        getinverse = getinverse)
}

##
# cacheSolve function takes matrix container created by makeCacheMatrix
# and checks if inverse matrix member had been set, if yes returns its value
# if inverse matrix member had not been set function
# - gets original matrix and calculates its inverse using solve() function
# - sets inverse matrix member to calculated value
# - returns inverse matrix
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
# retrieve inverse
        i <- x$getinverse()
# check if inverse had been set		
        if(!is.null(i)) {
		# yes - return existing (cached) inverse		
             message("getting cached inverse")
             return(i)
        }
		# no - get original matrix, calculate inverse using solve(), 
		# store in cache and return
        m <- x$get()
